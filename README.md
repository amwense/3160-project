# Introduction
In light of events affecting the student mobility on campus, universities are working to see if they should have their own deliveries services to prevent the stream of individuals who have no ties to the university. Thus, ensuring authorized university employees are the only ones delivering food on campus for safety and health reasons. Given certain requirement, I design a fully normalized database system using business rules, entity relationship diagramming, normalization and schema design modeling this system.
# Use Case
# Business Rules
# EERD
# MySQL Queries
# Trigger
# Stored Procedure
# Future Work
# MySQL Dump
